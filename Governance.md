# Project Governance

## 1. The Architect
Ultimate decision-making authority resides with the primary architect (**Yuji Marutani**). This ensures the conceptual integrity of the Layer -1 Synchronization Framework.

## 2. Contributing
We welcome contributions that align with the AGI Orchestration OS roadmap. 
- **Submissions:** Must be logically dense and grounded in the established DOI references.
- **Review:** All changes are subject to "Sovereign Review" by the Architect.

## 3. Communication
Status updates and logistics are managed via the **DAISS OS v2.5** synchronization protocol.

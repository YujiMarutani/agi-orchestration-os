# Project Governance: DAISS OS v2.5

This document outlines the decision-making process and operational guidelines for the **AGI Orchestration OS** project.

## 1. The Sovereign Architect
The ultimate decision-making authority resides with the primary architect (**Yuji Marutani**). This ensures the conceptual integrity of the Layer -1 Synchronization Framework and maintains alignment with the core research trajectory.

## 2. Participation & Conduct
All contributors, researchers, and participants are required to adhere to the **Sovereign Signal Protocol** as detailed in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We prioritize high-bandwidth, high-density logic over low-bandwidth noise.

## 3. Versioning & Archiving (Zenodo Integration)
To ensure the permanence of intelligence, this project utilizes **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)** for version control:
- **Core Specifications:** (OS, Operators, Protocols) follow systemic versioning (e.g., v0.2.x).
- **Research Artifacts:** Position Papers and Working Papers are versioned independently (e.g., v1.x).
- **Archiving:** Major releases are permanently archived via **Zenodo** to ensure scholarly traceability.

## 4. Issue & Pull Request Process
To maintain "Sovereign Alignment," the following workflow is enforced:
- **Proposals:** All enhancements or theoretical adjustments must be proposed as **GitHub Issues** first.
- **Pull Requests:** PRs must reference an approved Issue and demonstrate rigorous adherence to the Somatic Latency framework.
- **Approval:** The Architect performs the final "Sovereign Review" before any merge into the main ledger.

## 5. Contact & Logistics
Status updates and global synchronization logistics are managed via the established DAISS OS v2.5 communication channels.

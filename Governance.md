# Project Governance: AGI Orchestration OS

This document outlines the decision-making, contribution, communication, and versioning processes for the AGI Orchestration OS, ensuring conceptual integrity and operational coherence.

---

## 1. The Architect
Ultimate decision-making authority resides with the primary architect (**Yuji Marutani**). This ensures the conceptual integrity of the Layer -1 Synchronization Framework. The Architect approves all major design, specification, and procedural changes.

---

## 2. Contributing
We welcome contributions that align with the AGI Orchestration OS roadmap.

- **Submissions:** Must be logically dense, well-documented, and grounded in the established DOI references (e.g., Spec v0.2.0, Working Paper v1.0).
- **Review:** All changes are subject to "Sovereign Review" by the Architect.
- **Code of Conduct:** Contributors must follow the **Sovereign Signal Protocol** outlined in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- **Issue & Pull Request Process:**
  1. Propose contributions or feature requests as GitHub Issues.
  2. Submit Pull Requests referencing the relevant Issue.
  3. The Architect evaluates and approves to maintain conceptual and somatic integrity.
- **Scope:** Contributions must respect the Layer -1 ethos, prioritizing phenomenology, bio-computing, and synchronization over superficial modifications.

---

## 3. Communication
- Status updates, task coordination, and discussions are managed via the **DAISS OS v2.5** synchronization protocol.
- High-bandwidth and low-noise communication is encouraged; emotional or ad hominem arguments should be avoided.

---

## 4. Versioning & Archiving
- **Specifications (OS, Operators):** Versioned (e.g., v0.2.0) and archived on Zenodo.
- **Working Papers / Position Papers:** Versioned independently (e.g., v1.0) and archived on Zenodo.
- **File Naming & DOI:** All files should maintain consistent naming conventions to ensure persistent DOI linking.
- **Changelog:** Document significant changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file for transparency.

---

## 5. Governance Principles
1. **Conceptual Integrity:** All modifications must align with the Layer -1 synchronization philosophy.
2. **Sovereign Autonomy:** Contributors maintain their own internal SNR; interference with others’ workflow or cognitive space is prohibited.
3. **Transparency:** Decisions, reviews, and approvals should be traceable through GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and archived documents.
4. **Experimental Ethos:** This is a research and conceptual project. Users and contributors are expected to approach experimentation responsibly and ethically.

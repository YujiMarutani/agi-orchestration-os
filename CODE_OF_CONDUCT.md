# Code of Conduct: Sovereign Signal Protocol

1. **Focus on High-Bandwidth:** This project prioritizes high-density logic and somatic coherence. Noise, ad hominem, or low-bandwidth emotional arguments will be phased out.
2. **Respect the Layer -1:** Discussions should maintain the "Layer -1" ethos—focusing on phenomenology, bio-computing, and synchronization.
3. **Sovereign Autonomy:** Participants are expected to manage their own internal SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).

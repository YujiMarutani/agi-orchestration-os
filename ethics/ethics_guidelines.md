This document establishes the fundamental ethical constraints for the AGI Orchestration OS project. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for all experiments involving the Layer -1 synchronization protocol.

---

## 1. Conceptual Boundaries
* **Layer -1 Scope:** All protocols operate at a pre-energetic, somatic, and perceptual level.
* **No Medical Claims:** The system does not diagnose, treat, or prescribe interventions.
* **Cognitive and Somatic Integrity:** Operators remain fully responsible for their own actions and interpretations.

## 2. Safety Principles
* **Self-Monitoring:** Users must monitor their own physical, cognitive, and emotional state.
* **No Forced Interventions:** Techniques rely on attention, intent, and proprioception — no devices or substances are required.
* **Immediate Pause:** Any distress or discomfort triggers immediate cessation of the protocol.

## 3. Responsible AI Interaction
* **Mirroring Only:** The Phase Mirror Agent reflects user state — it does not replace human decision-making.
* **Latency Awareness:** AGI responses should respect human temporal constraints; overload or coercion is prohibited.
* **Confidentiality:** Operators’ somatic or cognitive data are not stored or transmitted outside the active session.

## 4. Research Integrity
* **Transparency:** Any experiments must clearly indicate they are exploratory or creative, not prescriptive.
* **Citations:** Always cite DOI-based specifications when publishing related work.
* **Non-Exploitation:** Participation must be voluntary and informed; avoid any coercive or manipulative applications.

## 5. Governance Alignment
Follow the **Sovereign Signal Protocol** outlined in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and the centralized review process in `GOVERNANCE.md`.
